The system leverages a combination of relational and object storage solutions to manage and store data efficiently.

- **Relational Database:** Utilized for structured data entities such as Emails, Applications, Merchant Details, Funding Details, Owner Information, Users, and Webhooks. The database ensures data integrity, supports complex queries, and facilitates relationships between entities.

- **Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage):** Employed for storing PDF attachments securely. Each attachment is categorized and stored in designated storage buckets based on its type (ISO Application, Bank Statement, Voided Cheque).

### Data Retention

- **Retention Policy:** All data, including emails, attachments, and extracted information, will be retained for a minimum of seven years to comply with financial regulations and company policies.

- **Archiving:** Data older than two years will be archived to cost-effective storage solutions, ensuring accessibility for auditing and reporting purposes.

### Redundancy

- **Database Redundancy:** Implemented through multi-az (availability zone) deployments to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

- **Storage Redundancy:** Object storage solutions offer built-in redundancy by replicating data across multiple physical locations within a region.

### Backup and Recovery

- **Automated Backups:** Daily automated backups of the relational database with point-in-time recovery capabilities to restore data to any specific moment within the backup retention period.

- **Snapshot Strategy:** Periodic snapshots of storage buckets to safeguard against accidental deletions or data corruption.

- **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Comprehensive strategies to restore system functionality within four hours in the event of a catastrophic failure, utilizing geographically dispersed backup sites.

## DATA PROCESSING

### Data Security

To ensure the security and integrity of data during processing, the following measures are implemented:

- **Data Encryption:** 
  - **At Rest:** All stored data, including database entries and attachments in object storage, are encrypted using AES-256 encryption.
  - **In Transit:** Data transmitted between system components and external clients is secured using TLS 1.2 or higher.

- **Access Control:**
  - **Authentication:** Utilizes OAuth 2.0 with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for verifying user identities.
  - **Authorization:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles and permissions.

- **Data Masking and Anonymization:** Sensitive information such as SSNs and Federal Tax IDs are masked or anonymized in non-production environments to protect privacy.

- **Logging and Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging of all data transactions and access attempts, monitored in real-time for any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
